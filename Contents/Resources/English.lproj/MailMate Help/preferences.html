<h1 id='preferences'>Preferences</h1>

<p>The “MailMate ▸ Preferences…” (⌘,) menu item provides access to a range of preferences which you can use to tweak the look and behavior of MailMate. If you do not find what you need then you can also try to take a look at the list of <a href='hidden_preferences.html'>hidden preferences</a>.</p>

<h2 id='general'>General</h2>

<p>The “Default Email Composer” is the email application used when the system needs an application to handle a URL. Most email clients support the <code>mailto:</code> URL scheme which is used to create new messages, but MailMate also supports the <code>message:</code>, <code>mid:</code>, <code>cid:</code> URL schemes. They are used to open messages by referring to the the value of <code>Message-ID</code> or <code>Content-ID</code> email headers.</p>

<p><a href='custom_key_bindings.html#background'>Custom key bindings</a> are described in a separate section.</p>

<p>In order to help the future development of MailMate then it is important that you consider reporting any issues you have with MailMate. This can be done easily and discreetly by allowing MailMate to automatically send any crash reports to Freron Software. If you also identify yourself then you may get some feedback as well with help or additional questions.</p>
<a name='notifications'> </a>
<h2 id='counters_notifications'>Counters (Notifications)</h2>

<p>MailMate allows you to configure 4 message counters which can be displayed in the dock and/or the menu bar. For each counter you need to select a mailbox and what to count in the mailbox. If displayed in the menu bar then each counter includes a submenu with up to the 10 most recent messages related to the counter. Selecting a message brings you to the relevant mailbox. Each counter can have its own sound which is triggered when a counter is increased due to the arrival of new messages. Finally, it is also possible to enable Growl notifications for each counter. An advanced <a href='format_string_syntax.html'>format string</a> can be used to define the information shown about the message. The same format string is used for the messages shown in the menu bar submenus.</p>
<img alt='Menu bar counters' src='images/menu_bar_counters.png' class='center' /><!--
Note that the set of available counters (All, Unread, Flagged, etc.) can also be [customized][count menu plist].

<h2 id='viewer'>Viewer</h2>

<p>Most of the viewer related preferences are self-explanatory. An exception is the option to “Prefer Plain Text”. This tells MailMate to display the plain text alternative of a message whenever such an alternative exists. This is useful if you dislike the look of the rich text (HTML) formatted messages you receive. You can always change the displayed alternative by using “View ▸ Message Body Parts ▸ Next/Previous Alternative” (⌥⌘] / ⌥⌘[) and MailMate will remember your choice for individual messages.</p>

<p>Inlined PDFs are shown using the <code>img</code> HTML tag (primarily to avoid PDF plugins), but the PDF format can be used for both small images and large PDF documents. This makes some users prefer to never inline PDFs. Note that you can always Quick Look attachments (⌘Y).</p>
<a name='composer_preferences'> </a>
<h2 id='composer'>Composer</h2>
<a name='markup_support'> </a>
<h3 id='markup_support'>Markup Support</h3>

<p>MailMate does not support rich text editing with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). Only plain text is allowed in the composer, but this does not mean that MailMate cannot generate nicely formatted messages when the need arises for emphasis, bullet points, code segments, or even tables.</p>

<p>If you enable “Markup support” in the Composer preferences then a popup menu for choosing a markup language is part of the bar below the headers in the Composer window. Currently, the only available markup language is <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Markdown</a>. With Markdown enabled MailMate is able to generate an HTML body part for the message as an alternative to the plain text body part. This is the opposite of what most email clients with rich text editing do. They have a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG'>WYSIWYG</a> editor for creating HTML and then they automatically generate a plain text body part based on the HTML.</p>

<p>The markup related popup menu in the Composer also includes an option to enable/disable the generation of the HTML body part. If disabled then MailMate only generates a standard plain text message, but it has a <code>markup</code> parameter in the <code>Content-Type</code> header with the value <code>markdown</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed; markup=markdown</code></pre>

<p>This can be used by the receiving email client to do the conversion to HTML (or another display format). MailMate is the only client which can do this, so this is only useful if you know the recipient uses MailMate or if you do not care whether the recipient sees the raw markdown text (which is very readable plain text) or an HTML formatted message.</p>

<p>The following are some technical facts about the current implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard Markdown has special <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p'>line break rules</a>. Consecutive lines are merged into paragraphs and a hard line break is then done by using two or more spaces at the end of a line. In MailMate, all line breaks are hard line breaks in order to work well with email clients which handle Markdown formatted text as ordinary plain text. This has some drawbacks though.</li>

<li>The defaults for markup language and HTML generation can be configured in the Preferences (Composer pane).</li>

<li>When replying to a message, markup language is disabled if the received message does not have the <code>markup</code> parameter or if the markup language is unknown.</li>

<li>Currently, an HTML body part is never generated if no markup is used in the message.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='attachments_check'>Attachments Check</h3>

<p>Before sending a message, MailMate makes a series of sanity checks. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refuse to send if there are no recipients.</li>

<li>If the subject has been changed by the user in a reply then ask the user to confirm that the message is still intended as a reply instead of as a new message. This is important with regard to inserting sensible reference headers.</li>

<li>If the message contains an attachment-related word in an unquoted part of the body while the message has no attachments then ask the user to verify that the lack of attachments was intentional. The words looked for are currently defined by a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression'>regular expression</a> in the Composer preferences pane.</li>

<li>If the message has no subject then the user is asked to verify that it is intentional.</li>

<li>If the message has no body text then the user is asked to verify that it is intentional.</li>
</ul>
<img alt='Subject Change' src='images/subject_change.png' class='center' />
<h2 id='signatures'>Signatures</h2>

<p>The signatures preferences pane allows you to add, delete, and edit the set of available signatures. You can also configure whether you prefer so-called top or bottom posting.</p>

<h2 id='tags'>Tags</h2>

<p>Add, remove, and order the tags available when using the tags editor. It is also possible to change the default shortcut for opening the tags editor. Note that the IMAP keyword for a tag is automatically derived from the tag name, but it is also possible to manually enter the IMAP keyword. When to enter an IMAP keyword MailMate automatically tries to complete the keywords based on any keywords used for existing messages.</p>

<h3 id='hidden_preference'>Hidden Preference</h3>

<p>Often only 4 or 5 key strokes are needed to add a tag, but if you want it to be even faster for your most often used tags then you can enable the following hidden preference:</p>

<pre><code>defaults write com.freron.MailMate -bool MmTagsPreferencesKeyEquivalentsColumnEnabled YES</code></pre>

<p>This enables an additional column in the “Tags” preferences pane for entering key equivalents. Note that these are in plain text format (the main reason this feature is currently hidden). The plain text format is documented <a href='custom_key_bindings.html#background'>here</a>.</p>
<a name='security_preferences'> </a>
<h2 id='security'>Security</h2>

<h3 id='image_blocking'>Image Blocking</h3>

<p>By default, MailMate makes sure that email messages can never <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug#E-mail_web_bugs'>“phone home”</a>. This happens by blocking all external references for all HTML messages displayed in MailMate. Using the Security preferences pane you can make MailMate less strict. The most important setting is “Enable for messages in:” which allows the user to define a mailbox containing the messages for which blocking should be enabled. The default is “All Messages”, but it could be the universal “Inbox” or any smart mailbox, for example, a smart mailbox excluding messages which have been identified as being safe. This could be based on headers inserted by server-side spam detection software (like <code>X-Spam-Score</code> or <code>X-Spam-Flag</code>).</p>

<p>For convenience, the preferences also include a checkbox titled “Unless messages are marked explicitly as Not Junk” (this could also be done using a smart mailbox as described above). This is especially useful when combined with a SpamSieve option described below which allows you to automatically mark messages as “Not Junk” if they have a low spam score.</p>

<p>Note that blocking is always enabled for messages in “Junk” or “Deleted Messages”. It is also always enabled for attached messages. This allows one to safely receive spam forwarded using something like “Message ▸ Forward as Attachment&#8230;”.</p>

<h3 id='spamsieve'>SpamSieve</h3>

<p><a href='http://c-command.com/spamsieve/'>SpamSieve</a> is a third party software application which can be used to identify spam messages automatically. If enabled, MailMate attempts to launch SpamSieve when it receives a message in the mailbox configured in the Security preferences. MailMate also informs SpamSieve whenever the spam state of a message is changed.</p>

<h3 id='openpgp_and_smime'>OpenPGP and S/MIME</h3>

<p>MailMate supports both of the major protocols used for signing and encrypting emails. The <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5751'>S/MIME</a> support does not require any additional software. It uses Apple&#8217;s security framework and certificates. The <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880'>OpenPGP</a> support requires the <code>gpg2</code> command to be available. This is most easily installed using the MacGPG2 part of <a href='https://www.gpgtools.org'>GPGTools</a>. It is also recommended to install the “GPG Keychain Access” part of GPGTools. <strong>Warning:</strong> Older versions of the GPGMail part of GPGTools can break the native S/MIME support in Apple Mail.</p>

<p>It is possible to allow MailMate to index decrypted messages. This allows you to search within encrypted messages, but it also means that decrypted text is added to database files. Make sure you understand the implications of doing this. Note that if you change this setting then it only affects messages which have not yet been decrypted. Also note that attachments are saved in a decrypted state to disk if viewed.</p>
<!-- CID and content type are always added. -->
<p>A banner is shown above the message for all signed and/or encrypted messages. You can disable this banner for messages which are successfully verified and/or decrypted, but it is always shown if there are any issues. Most often a “Show Details” button is available. For S/MIME messages this allows you to review the related certificate. For OpenPGP messages it shows the output from the <code>gpg2</code> command. The latter is documented <a href='http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gnupg.git;a=blob_plain;f=doc/DETAILS;hb=refs/heads/STABLE-BRANCH-2-0'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that MailMate always allows you to enable signing/encryption for a message. If it is not possible to actually do it then you are warned if you try to send the message.</p>
